I am using a ESP32S3 
MAX98357A as amplifier

It's a web radio that plays by default
it connects to a Bluetooth dial. Turn the dial to change volume
Tap the dial to stop/play the stream

Show debug message about the bluetooth connection state.
If the dial isn't connected try to connect automatically
